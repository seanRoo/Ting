### TING

Ting is a tinnitus management app created with `React Native` that focuses on helping its users keep track of their tinnitus.<br />
The user will submit daily check-ins and track how their tinnitus is affecting them for that day and have those values displayed in graph form to facilitate the identification of possible correlations in the data, e.g lack of sleep causing the sound intensity to increase. <br/>
The app tracks values such as 'Stress Level', 'Sound Intensity', 'Sound Pitch', 'Hours of Sleep' & 'Mood'.
